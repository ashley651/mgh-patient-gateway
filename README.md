## Technologies Used
- **React.js:** React.js is a powerful JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building interactive user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of those components efficiently.
- **Node.js:** Node.js is a runtime environment that enables server-side scripting using JavaScript. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and allows developers to build scalable and high-performance server applications. Node.js is renowned for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it particularly effective for handling concurrent requests and real-time data.
In this project, Node.js handles backend services, including API requests, data processing, and server-side logic, ensuring smooth operations and efficient data management.
- **CSS3:** CSS3 is the latest version of the Cascading Style Sheets language, which is used to define the look and layout of web pages. It includes features such as advanced selectors, responsive design, animations, and transitions, which help in creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.
- **HTML5:** HTML5 is the fifth iteration of the Hypertext Markup Language, which is used for structuring and presenting content on the web. It introduces new elements and APIs that enhance multimedia capabilities and improve the user experience. Features such as semantic elements, form controls, and improved support for audio and video are integral to modern web development.
- **Webpack:** Webpack is a popular module bundler that compiles JavaScript modules and other assets like CSS, images, and fonts into a single or multiple bundles. It optimizes the code for production by minifying files, managing dependencies, and enabling features like hot module replacement for development.
